## Introduction:
Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone can not know the presence or contents of the hidden message. The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that a message is communicated. Although steganography differs from cryptography, there are many analogies between the two, and some authors classify steganography as a form of cryptography since hidden communication is a type of secret message.

## Examples of Steganography:
Steganography is practiced by those wishing to convey a secret message or code. While there are many legitimate uses for steganography, malware developers have also been found to use steganography to obscure the transmission of malicious code.
Forms of steganography have been used for centuries and include almost any technique for hiding a secret message in an otherwise harmless container. For example, using invisible ink to hide secret messages in otherwise inoffensive messages; hiding documents recorded on microdot -- which can be as small as 1 millimeter in diameter -- on or inside legitimate-seeming correspondence; and even by using multiplayer gaming environments to share information.

## Approach used: Least Significant Bit 
We can describe a digital image as a finite set of digital values, called pixels. Pixels are the smallest individual element of an image, holding values that represent the brightness of a given color at any specific point. So we can think of an image as a matrix (or a two-dimensional array) of pixels which contains a fixed number of rows and columns.
Least Significant Bit (LSB) is a technique in which the last bit of each pixel is modified and replaced with the secret messageâ€™s data bit.
